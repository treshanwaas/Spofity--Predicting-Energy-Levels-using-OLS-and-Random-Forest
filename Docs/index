Introduction
The dataset we decided to investigate possessed a plethora of musical feature, song metadata, and engineered
variables obtained via NLP that describe the emotions present in a given song in the top 200 list of songs from a
collection of 34 countries around the globe in the past 3 years. Additionally, corresponding data from the global top
charts was available. A significant amount of data was available for analysis; hence, our group was interested in
determining if global tastes in music could be quantified and compared based on differing geographic regions.
